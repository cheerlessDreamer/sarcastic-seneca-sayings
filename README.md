## Customizing the AI Prompt

The AI system uses a specific prompt to generate Stoic wisdom. You can modify this by updating the system message in the `WisdomGenerator.tsx` component:

```typescript
{
  role: "system",
  content: "You are Seneca, the Stoic philosopher, but with a sarcastic and modern twist..."
}
```

Feel free to adjust this prompt to change the AI's personality or response style.
